The source in this repository inteds to illustrate the use of BDD.

Folder structure of the project:
	MediaLibrary
		--- MavenThought.MediaLibrary.sln : Main solution file
		--- Rakefile: Main rake file to launch build, test, etc. Do rake -T to get all the tasks available.
		--- MavenThought.MediaLibrary.msbuild : MsBuild main file (use rake when possible)
		+-- main: Project files included in the solution
		+-- test: Test project files included in the solution
		+-- lib: Dependencies used by all the projects (nhibernate, nunit, mbunit, etc)
		+-- tools: Tools used to run tests, msbuild tasks, etc.
		
Please read my post with the introduction to the BDD session at http://orthocoders.com/2010/05/26/real-world-bdd-introduction.

Prerequisites to run it:
	* Rake: Install ruby or iron ruby with ruby gems to get rake.
		Here some instructions: http://marcinobel.com/index.php/rake-net-projects-installation-setup/
	
Prerequisites to modify it:
	* VS 2010
	* ASP .NET MVC 2: http://www.asp.net/mvc
	* Gallio: Download from http://ccnet.gallio.org
	* Specflow 1.3.0: http://www.specflow.org
	
Good to have (highly recommended)
	* Resharper: http://www.jetbrains.com
	* VSCommands: Tool to group and ungroup items (recommended, not required)

Sanity check:
	* From command prompt, on the root of the project run "rake -T", u should see all the tasks.
	* From command prompt, on the root of the project run "rake build"
	* From command prompt, on the root of the project run "rake test:all", all tests should run, u should see the output on the command window.
	* From command prompt, on the root of the project run "rake test:features", all the features should run, u should see the browser 
	  appear and dissaper, and the output on the command window. The result should look something like:
	  
		Tests run: 3, Errors: 0, Failures: 0, Inconclusive: 1, Time.....
	
If u r attending the presentation and have any issues setting up the code feel free to find me and letting me know, I'll help you with the setup.

Any comments, bugs, issues, please let me know.

Enjoy.
